# Treasure Map

# This is a difficult challenge. 💪
# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
# This is a bit hard to work with. We've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
# to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']


# Example Input 1
# B3

# Example Output 1
# Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.
# ['⬜️', '️⬜️', '️⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '️⬜️']
# ['⬜️️', 'X', '⬜️️']


line1 = ["⬜️", "️⬜️", "️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️", "⬜️️", "⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure?") # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇

letter = position[0].lower()
abc = ["a", "b", "c"]
letter_index = abc.index(letter)
number_index = int(position [1]) - 1
map[number_index][letter_index] = "X"

# Write your code above this row 👆

print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
