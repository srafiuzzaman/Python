# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is *z*."

# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"

# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# These functions will help you:
# lower() count()

print("The Love Calculator is calculating your score...")
name1 = input("What is your name? ") # What is your name?
name2 = input("What is their name? ") # What is their name?
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

combined_names = name1 + name2
uppercase_names = combined_names.upper()

T = uppercase_names.count("T")
R = uppercase_names.count("R")
U = uppercase_names.count("U")
E = uppercase_names.count("E")
first_digit = T + R + U + E

L = uppercase_names.count("L")
O = uppercase_names.count("O")
V = uppercase_names.count("V")
E = uppercase_names.count("E")
second_digit = L + O + V + E

score = str(first_digit) + str(second_digit)
if int(score) < 10 or int(score) > 90:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif int(score) > 40 and int(score) < 50:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {score}.")
