# Day 1 Project - Band Name Generator

# 1. Create a greeting for your program.
# 2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in and store it in a variable.
# 3. Ask the user for the name of a pet and store it in a variable.
# 4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
# 5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:

print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
