# This program takes two inputs. The first input is stored in a variable called a.
# The second input is stored in a variable called b.
# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
# Warning . You don't need to print anything. The print statement is already in the template code.
# However, your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

#Given:
'''
# There are two variables, a and b from input
a = input()
b = input()
