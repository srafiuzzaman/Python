# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
# But when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
# e.g. it might start off like this:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# ... etc

# Create a loop with For and Range to go from 1 to 100.
for number in range(1, 101):
    # First check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")

    # Then check if the number is only divisible by 3
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")

    # Finally check if the number is only divisible by 5
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")

    # If it's not divisible by either of those numbers, just print the number
    else:
        print(number)
