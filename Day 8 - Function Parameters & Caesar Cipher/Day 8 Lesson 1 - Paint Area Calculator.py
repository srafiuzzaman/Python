# Paint Area Calculator

# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
# Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
#
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) ÷ coverage per can.
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
#                = 1.6
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
#
# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
#
# Example Input
# 3
# 9

# Example Output
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.

# Hint
# Stackoveflow link on how to round up a number:

# Write your code below this line 👇
import math
def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    num_of_cans = (height * width) / cover
    round_up_cans = math.ceil(num_of_cans)
    print(f"You'll need {round_up_cans} cans of paint.")


# Write your code above this line 👆
# Define a function called paint_calc() so the code below works.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
test_h = int(input("Height of wall in meters")) # Height of wall (m)
test_w = int(input("Width of wall in meters")) # Width of wall (m)
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
