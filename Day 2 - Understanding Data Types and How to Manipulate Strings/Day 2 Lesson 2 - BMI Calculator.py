# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person
# both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
import math

# Given input: 1.65, 72

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
int_weight = int(weight)
float_height = float(height)
bmi = int_weight / float_height ** 2
print(int(bmi))
