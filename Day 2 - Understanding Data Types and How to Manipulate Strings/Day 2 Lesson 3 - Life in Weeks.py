# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Given input: 56

age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52
print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left.")

# Answer: You have 1768 weeks left.
