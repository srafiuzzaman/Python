# Dictionary in List

# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a
# List that contains 2 Dictionaries. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.
#
# Write a function that will work with the following line of code to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.
#
# add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.
#
# Example Input
# Brazil
# 5
# ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]
#
# Example Output
# I've been to Brazil 5 times.
# My favourite city was Sao Paulo.
#
# Hint
# Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.
# The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.
# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

country = input("Add country name: ") # Add country name
visits = int(input("Number of visits: ")) # Number of visits
list_of_cities = eval(input("List the cities you visited: ")) # create list from formatted string

travel_log = [
  {
    "country": "France",
    "visits": 12,
    "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
  },
  {
    "country": "Germany",
    "visits": 5,
    "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
  },
]
# Do NOT change the code above ðŸ‘†

# TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries to be added to the travel_log.

    travel_log.append(new_country)
